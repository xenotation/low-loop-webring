# Под Нет

A small [webring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webring) run by artist and independent theorist [Nikola Stoyanov](https://newdegeneration.xyz/bio/).

This webring showcases webbased endpoints for the work of artists, theorist and researchers, mianly but not limited to Bulgaria. 
The site has been handcrafted in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with a minimalist design that prioritizes clarity and accessibility.

The borders of the site are styled using [Broider](https://maxbittker.github.io/broider/), a tool for creating custom 9-patch borders, adding a unique aesthetic touch to the site. It also makes use of [Neko 3.0](https://webneko.net/) a software pet cat that runs around on the screen, chasing the mouse cursor. The original software based on this concept was written in the 1980's by Naoshi Watanabe (若田部 直). It was called NEKO.COM and ran on the Japanese computer NEC PC-9801 in the MS-DOS command line. More info abouts its history can be found here: [Neko: History of a Software Pet](https://eliotakira.com/neko/). The font used is USA military standard number 33558, version C since January 26, 1968 (MS33558C), which defines the standard form of characters, numbers and Latin letters, applied to instrument panels of military aircrafts.
