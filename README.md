A small [webring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webring) run and developed by artist and independent theorist [Nikola Stoyanov](https://newdegeneration.xyz/bio/).

This ring collects web-based endpoints of artists, theorists, and researchers — mainly, but not limited to, Bulgaria.  
The site is handcrafted in **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** with a minimalist design focused on clarity and accessibility. Slots are limited and added on request.

It is an exercise in **simplicity**: no frameworks, no databases, no server logic. Static files, open contributions via GitHub.

## Purpose

Encourage creators to build their own websites and share traffic — a small counter to the disposability and spam of Web 2.0.  
We welcome hand-built portfolios, blogs, research pages, and other singular projects.

## Technical

- **Stack:** Pure HTML, CSS, JavaScript.  
- **Design:**  
  - Borders via [Broider](https://maxbittker.github.io/broider/).  
  - A **modified** [Neko 3.0](https://webneko.net/) (centered on screen).  
  - Typeface: **US Military Standard MS33558C** (1968).  
- **Automation:** A GitHub Action parses `data.json`, filters placeholders, generates JSON-LD, and injects it statically into `index.html` for SEO.

This keeps the site transparent, reproducible, fast, and easy to maintain.
