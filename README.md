A small [webring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webring) ran and developed by artist and independent theorist [Nikola Stoyanov](https://newdegeneration.xyz/bio/).

This webring showcases web based endpoints for the work of artists, theorist and researchers, mainly but not limited to Bulgaria. 
The site has been handcrafted in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with a minimalist design that prioritizes clarity and accessibility. The amout of slots are limited and available on a per request basis.

It is an attempt at inspiring artists, theorists and developers to build websites and share traffic amongst one another, as manner to combat the endless spam and drivel of web 2.0 and beyond. The ring welcomes hand-crafted portfolios, blogs, projects and anything wierd, strange and interesting you think could fit into our little hangout. 

The borders of the site are styled using [Broider](https://maxbittker.github.io/broider/), a tool for creating custom 9-patch borders. It also makes use of [Neko 3.0](https://webneko.net/) a software pet cat that runs around on the screen, chasing the mouse cursor. The original software based on this concept was written in the 1980's by Naoshi Watanabe (若田部 直). It was called NEKO.COM and ran on the Japanese computer NEC PC-9801 in the MS-DOS command line. More info abouts its history can be found here: [Neko: History of a Software Pet](https://eliotakira.com/neko/). The font used is USA military standard number 33558, version C since January 26, 1968 (MS33558C), which defines the standard form of characters, numbers and Latin letters, applied to instrument panels of military aircrafts.
